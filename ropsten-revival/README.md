Included here is a python script for scraping transactions from a chain RLP export, a js script to replay those transactions with `eth_sendRawTransaction`. The Ropsten revival transaction replay process was done for 251574 transactions (scraped from blocks between #585000 and #722677), out which 5627 replays failed with an `Insufficient funds for gas * price + value` error. These "insufficient funds" failures are due to the sending account having mined blocks and earned block rewards on the original chain, after the revival fork block at 585000; on the revived chain, these sending accounts do not have funds since they did earn any block rewards. A second round of replays to fix these 5627 failures could be done by first funding the sending accounts with faucet ether, and then performing the replays. Also note that the success of the other replays has not been comprehensively verified. A quick check showed that the vast majority succeeded, but some were evicted from the tx pool before being included in a block if there was a gap between the tx's nonce and the sending account's nonce at the time it was added to the tx pool (this would happen when replaying a series of tx's that were sent from the same account in quick succession).
